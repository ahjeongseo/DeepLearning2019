    "# M2177.003100 Deep Learning <br> Assignment #3 Part 3: Language Modeling with CharRNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Copyright (C) Data Science Laboratory, Seoul National University. This material is for educational uses only. Some contents are based on the material provided by other paper/book authors and may be copyrighted by them. Written by Sang-gil Lee, October 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a character-level language model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",
    "It has become very popular as a starter kit for learning how RNN works in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, what is \"language modeling\" anyway? Intuitively, \"language modeling\" is teaching the model about a general probability distribution of our words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we ask the model like: \"hey just say whatever words from your estimation of the wikipedia word distribution\", and the model responds like \"ok, i learned from wikipedia, and the most frequent word is \"the\". so let me start with \"the\". the wikipedia is blah blah blah\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by teaching the model to speak for itself, we can test the model's capability of learning temporal relationships between sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original blog post & code:\n",
    "https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn\n",
    "http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\n",
    "\n",
    "But the original code is written in lua torch which looks less pretty :(\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a clean port of char-RNN in TensorFlow\n",
    "https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow\n",
    "This iPython notebook is basically a copypasta of this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, you are allowed to copy paste the codes from the original repo.\n",
    "HOWEVER, <font color=red> try to implement the model yourself first </font>, and consider the original source code as a last resort.\n",
    "You will learn a lot while wrapping around your head during the implementation. And you will understand nuts and bolts of RNNs more clearly in a code level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU JUST BLINDLY COPY PASTE THE CODE, YOU SHALL RUIN YOUR EXAM.\n",
    "### The exam is designed to be solvable for students that actually have written the code themselves.\n",
    "At least strictly re-type the codes from the original repo line-by-line, and understand what each line means thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting your work:\n",
    "<font color=red>**DO NOT clear the final outputs**</font> so that TAs can grade both your code and results.  \n",
    "Once you have done **all Assignment Part 1-5**, run the *CollectSubmission.sh* script with your **Team number** as input argument. <br>\n",
    "This will produce a zipped file called *[Your team number].zip*. Please submit this file on ETL. &nbsp;&nbsp; (Usage: ./*CollectSubmission.sh* team_#)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character language modeling (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is an on/off one: just make this notebook **\"work\"** without problem by: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. implementing **1. \\_\\_init\\_\\_()** and **2. sample()** of RNN **Model()** class from **char_rnn.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. briefly summarizing, at the end of the script, how you implmeneted the model & why you changed some other parts of the code. yes,  <font color=red> there are other intentional pitfalls inside the code </font>. just copy-pasting the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() will not work. can you tell me why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Definition of **\"work\"** is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training loss must be <font color=red> below 0.2 </font>. We will check the training loss output from the training code block. We don't split the data into train-valid-test. Don't forget to <font color=red> NOT clear the output from train(args)</font>, where the training loss will be printed! TA will check the logged output from train(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. calling sample(args.sample) at the last code block <font color=red> must generate some meaningful sentences </font>. The quality of the sentence does not count, unless the generated sentence is something like \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbb\" or \"b\" u tlttfcwaU c  fGcnrh i.\\nh mt he!bsthpme\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Now proceed to the code."
